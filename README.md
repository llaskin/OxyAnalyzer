# OxyAnalyzer
This is Arduino code for a compressor analyzer when running a nitrox stick.  This is setup to require 2 oxygen analyzer sensors and 1 pressure sensor.

Attach one oxygen sensor into the bottom of your trimix stick, before it reaches the inlet valve of your compressor, but after oxygen has had thorough amounts of time to mix.
Attach one oxygen sensor to a location just after your compressor, ideally before it hits your scuba tanks/bank.
Attach the pressure sensor to your bank in the appropriate location.
